<h1>Contribute financially</h1>
<p>I encourage everyone to self-host GoatCounter if they have the inclination to
do so, which is why it's 100% Open Source (or “Free”) software.</p>

<p>I work on this full-time: it's not a side-project I work on in spare time,
it's my means of living. Please consider making a financial contribution if this
is useful for you to ensure the long-term viability.</p>

<p>Thank you :-)</p>
